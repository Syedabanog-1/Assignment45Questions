can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else
to invite.

 the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make
  it.
 • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make
 it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
 • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who
  is still in your list. */
