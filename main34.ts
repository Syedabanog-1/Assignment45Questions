/* /* 34.  Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza.
 Store these pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print
  the name of each pizza.
• Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
 instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you 
 should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I
  like pepperoni pizza.
• Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that
 states how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or
  more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional 
  sentence, such as I really love pizza!*/
